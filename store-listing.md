## Tips for Taking Screenshots

1. Use Expo on a simulator/emulator with the correct resolution
2. Add some sample data first so screens look populated
3. You can use tools like **Fastlane Screengrab** (Android) or **Fastlane Snapshot** (iOS)
4. Or use **screenshots.pro** / **AppMockup** to add device frames and marketing text
5. Each screenshot should have a short headline overlay like:
   - "Track with the Bristol Scale"
   - "Monitor Color & Patterns"
   - "Your Complete History"
   - "Understand Your Gut"
   - "100% Private. Always."
