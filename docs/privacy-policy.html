        <h1>Flushy Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Effective date: February 10, 2026</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Flushy ("the App") is a personal gut health tracking application developed by Flushy ("we", "us", or "our"). Your privacy is fundamental to how Flushy is designed and built. This policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>In short: Flushy does not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on external servers. Everything stays on your device.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Flushy is designed with a strict local-first approach. We do not collect any personal data whatsoever. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal information (name, email, phone number, address)</li>
            <li>We do not require account creation, login, or registration</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs</li>
            <li>We do not transmit any data over the internet</li>
            <li>We do not use cookies, pixels, or similar tracking technologies</li>
            <li>We do not share, sell, or disclose data to third parties</li>
            <li>We do not access your device's health platforms (Apple Health, Google Health Connect)</li>
            <li>We do not collect device identifiers, IP addresses, or usage statistics</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All health-related data you enter into Flushy — including stool type, color, tags, timestamps, and your profile preferences — is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (AsyncStorage). This data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it</li>
            <li>Is protected by your device's own security measures (passcode, biometrics, encryption)</li>
            <li>Persists between app sessions</li>
            <li>Is deleted if you uninstall the App or use the in-app reset feature</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Backup and Data Export</h2>
        <p>Flushy offers optional features to export and back up your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Backup/Restore:</strong> You can create a JSON backup file of your data and save it using your device's native sharing capabilities (e.g., saving to iCloud Files, Google Drive, or sending via email). This process is entirely initiated and controlled by you. We do not retain, access, or transmit copies of your backup files.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF Health Report:</strong> You can generate a PDF report of your health data for personal use or to share with a healthcare provider. The report is created locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>Flushy may request permission to send local notifications if you enable daily reminders. These notifications are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scheduled and delivered entirely on your device</li>
            <li>Not connected to any external notification service or push server</li>
            <li>Fully optional and can be disabled at any time in the App's settings or your device's notification settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Flushy does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, including but not limited to analytics platforms, advertising networks, crash reporting tools, or social media services.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Flushy does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since the App does not collect any personal information from any user regardless of age, there is no risk of children's data being collected or processed.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any of your data on our servers, traditional data subject rights (access, deletion, portability) are handled directly on your device. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View all your data within the App at any time</li>
            <li>Export your data using the backup feature</li>
            <li>Delete all your data using the in-app "Reset App Data" feature</li>
            <li>Uninstall the App to remove all associated data from your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
